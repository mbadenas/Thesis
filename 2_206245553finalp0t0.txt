# Column 1 shows the period (row 1) and its uncertainty (row 2). 
#                Column 2 gives t0 (row 1) and its uncertainty (row 2). Light curves with only two
#                transits have uncertainties equal to 0.0. This is NOT because 0.0 is their 
#                actual value, but because we couldn't calculate it with only two points.
