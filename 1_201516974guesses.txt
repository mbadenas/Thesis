# Best fit parameters. These are: 
#                Depth, Impact parameter, time of transit, sigma (additional white noise),
#                Sum of LD coefficients,  Mass of the star, Radius of the star (gaussian priors
#                on both), the out of eclipse flux, and the standard deviation of the 
#                out-of-transit flux.
