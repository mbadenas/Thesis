# Transit time estimates (t0). The 1st column represents the 50% percentile of the MCMC posterior 
#             distribution. The 2nd and 3rd show respectively the +1 and -1 sigma uncertainty. Each row is a transit 
#             in the light curve (i.e. row 1 = transit 1, row 2 = transit 2, etc.).
